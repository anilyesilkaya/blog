By definition, in an $$M$$-ary digital modulation scheme, we send any one of $$M$$ possible signals, $$s_1(t),s_2(t),\cdots,s_M(t)$$ during each signalling (symbol) interval of duration $$T$$. In almost all applications, $$M = 2^m$$, where $$m$$ is a positive integer which represent the number of bits per symbol. Thus, the symbol duration becomes $$ T = m\cdot T_b $$, where $$T_b$$ is the bit duration.

The $$M$$-ary modulation schemes preferred over binary modulation schemes for transmitting digital data  over pass-band channels when the requirement is to conserve bandwidth *at the expense of both increased power and increased system complexity*.
